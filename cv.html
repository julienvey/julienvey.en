		<p class="content-cv">For the last 2 years and a half, I have been working in a small IT company called Zenika, located in Paris. I work as a developper on various projects for our clients. I contribute to the animation of the company, internally by animating workshops and presentation and also externally by writing blog posts and presenting talks at conferences and user groups. I also have the charge of creating, updating and animating various training courses such as Git, GWT, OSGi... Following are the main projects I worked on while at Zenika.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="content-cv">I arrived in the early stages of the Hope project, designed to make accesible automation devices and scenarios through the "BBox", home internet box provided by Bouygues Telecom for their clients. My first contribution to the project was to industrialize it, setting up build tools, continuous integration, source control. Then I took the charge of building the communication layer between the boxes and the central server, as well as developping this last one.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">The communication layer consists of a bidirectionnal REST API, one part exposed on the box side, the other on the server side. On the box side, we had constraints about which version of Java to use, we were limited to 1.3 so I had to use good old-fashionned techniques to build a REST API. On the server side, I used Spring MVC to expose controllers through REST.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">To server side was used to monitor the boxes and their devices and also create and deploy scenarios. I created a small application using AngularJS for the frontend, a REST API with SpringMVC and a minimal persistance using MyBatis as the ORM.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="content-cv">I arrived on this project to refactor an internal CRM application, previously using JSF2, to GWT. It was a test project in Generali to help assess the credibility of GWT as a replacement for all JSF applications. I contributed to the design of the application, using most of GWT best practices and frameworks, Gin, UiBinder, MVP, Activities & Places... We also externalized a set of reusable components for usages in other internal projects. I developped the differents parts of the UI, as well as the server-side part. On the server-side, we had almost no persistance, all the data were retrieved from third party SOAP web services. We were using CXF for the web service layer.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">Next to this, I migrated the continuous integration from a Bamboo instance to Jenkins. I automated builds and deployment using a combination of Maven and Jenkins plugins (Maven release, promoted builds...) I also animated technical developpers meetings about code techniques and frameworks.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="content-cv">When I first arrived at General Electric, I was assigned a small project, a mobile and offline web application to demonstrate the use of new web technologies to build robust and trustworthy mobile applications. I decided to use JQTouch, which was certainly one of the most advanced framework at the time. It combined JavaScript and CSS3 to ensure to the web app the look & feel of a native application. I set up the offline mode using HTML5 APIs, ApplicationCache and WebDatabase.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">After this project, I joined the team working on the main project, simply called MDM. It was a full stack application using (from bottom to top) an Oracle Database, Hibernate as the ORM, a full Spring architecture with transaction management, AOP, REST Services and GWT as the presentation framework. MDM purpose was to ensure the quality of data among multiple repositories, sources or destinations. We had about 10 so called repositories among Europe. We developped synchronisation agents (ETL like) to connect to this repositories. Some were simple database access, but we also had web services to call or mail updates to treat.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">At some time during this project, I personnaly focused on creating and deploying a Business Process Management solution using JBPM. I created and integrated in the application, process for third party creation and also capital expenditure.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">During all this project, we ensured quality by providing continuous integration, unit tests, integration tests...</p>

		<p class="content-cv">During my training, I did three internships. The first one was a three months internship at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, US. It was mainly a network architecture job.</p> 

		<p class="content-cv">During my engineering course, I did a three months internship in a Research center in France, INRIA. I worked on a solution to help observe and analyse the behaviour of parallels computer programs written in C with OpenMP, running on multicore embedded devices. I mainly used observation APIs (PAPI and POMP) to create the observation tool.</p>

		<p class="content-cv">Finally, for my last-year internship, I spent 6 months at Bull, in Grenoble to work on the Open Source project called Jasmine, which is a monitoring tool for JEE Application Servers and especially JOnAS, which was developped by the same team. The technologies in action were OSGi for the backend and Flex for the monitoring interface.</p>
